# SYNC Methods
Methods used for synchronizing data between the server and specific clients without relying on built-in systems that continuously send traffic even when there are no changes (NWVars) or only send data to players within the target's PVS (NW2Vars).

*NOTE*: These values are synchronized at the exact moment the method is called and that is it. They are *not* sent to new players upon joining the game.
